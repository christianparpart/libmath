    Hi reader,

This is my Math Type Library (MTL) and is part of the SurakWare Projects.
If you believe that this package is out of date have a look at
http://www.surakware.net/downloads/index.xml

I am using GCC/3.0.3 with automake/1.5 and autoconf/2.50 (and
doxygen 1.2.14). You'll perhaps need these things too if you wanna get the 
same results as me;)

GCC/3.x is a must since it is really more standard compliant than
its prio versions.
However, I'll try to code it backward compatible (using #ifdefs).

For building that package the first time you may execute the
script bootstrap. However, you shall read that script before you
do execute it.

To create the user API-documentation, call make using parameter api-doc
at top source dir or in the doc directory itself.
> make api-doc

Thanks,
